The main database for structural data is called the PDB (protein Data Bank). Let's see what it contains:


```{r}
PDB <- read.csv("ProteinData.csv" , row.names = 1)

PDB
```
```{r}
PDB$Total

```

```{r}
as.numeric(sub(",", "", PDB$Total))

```

I could turn this into a function to fix the whole table or any future table I read like this:

```{r}
x <- PDB$Total
as.numeric(sub(",", "", x))
```

```{r}
comma2numeric <- function(x) {
  as.numeric(sub(",", "", x))
}
```

```{r}
comma2numeric(PDB$X.ray)
```


```{r}
apply(PDB, 2, comma2numeric)
```

##Or try a differnt read/import funciton:

```{r}
library(readr)
PDBN <- read_csv("ProteinData.csv")

PDBN$Total
```

```{r}
sum(PDBN$Total)
```



> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
Combined.Percent <- ((sum(PDBN$'X-ray') + sum(PDBN$'EM') ) / sum(PDBN$Total) ) * 100

XRay.Percent <- (sum(PDBN$'X-ray') / sum(PDBN$Total) ) * 100

EM.Percent <- sum(PDBN$'EM') / sum(PDBN$Total)  * 100


Combined.Percent 

XRay.Percent

EM.Percent 

```




```{r}
PDBN
```


> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}

PDBN$Total[1] / sum(PDBN$'Total')


```

> Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

226114


Bio3D Package very useful

```{r}
library(bio3d)

pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```


```{r}
attributes(pdb)

head(pdb$atom)
```




> Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?

Hydrogens have little to no electron density.

> Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have

308

> Q6: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend “Ball & Stick” for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.

Discussion Topic: Can you think of a way in which indinavir, or even larger ligands and substrates, could enter the binding site?




> Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object? 

```{r}
sum(pdb$calpha)

length (pdbseq(pdb))
```
198 amino acids


> Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues? 



> Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure? 

```{r}
unique(pdb$atom$chain)
```
2 chains




```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

```{r}
m <- nma(adk)

plot(m)
```

Writes PDB file to make animation of predicted motions.
```{r}
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")

```

I can open this in Mol* to play the trajectory...



CLASS 11



```{r}
#install.packages("bio3d")

#library(bio3d)
```

## Here we will find and analyze all ADK structures in the PDB database


```{r}
aa <- get.seq("1ake_A")
```

> Q10. Which of the packages above is found only on BioConductor and not CRAN? 

The `msa` package is from BioConductor

> Q11. Which of the above packages is not found on BioConductor or CRAN?: 

N/A

> Q12. True or False? Functions from the devtools package can be used to install packages from GitHub and BitBucket? 

True

> Q13. How many amino acids are in this sequence, i.e. how long is this sequence? 

```{r}

> Q14. What do you note about this plot? Are the black and colored lines similar or different? Where do you think they differ most and why?
