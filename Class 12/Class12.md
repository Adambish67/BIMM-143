Section 4: Population Scale Analysis \[HOMEWORK\] One sample is
obviously not enough to know what is happening in a population. You are
interested in assessing genetic differences on a population scale. So,
you processed about ~230 samples and did the normalization on a genome
level. Now, you want to find whetherthere is any association of the 4
asthma-associated SNPs (rs8067378â€¦) on ORMDL3 expression.

``` r
expr <- read.table("Genome.txt")
head(expr)
```

       sample geno      exp
    1 HG00367  A/G 28.96038
    2 NA20768  A/G 20.24449
    3 HG00361  A/A 31.32628
    4 HG00135  A/A 34.11169
    5 NA18870  G/G 18.25141
    6 NA11993  A/A 32.89721

``` r
nrow(expr)
```

    [1] 462

``` r
table(expr$geno)
```


    A/A A/G G/G 
    108 233 121 

Q14: Generate a boxplot with a box per genotype, what could you infer
from the relative expression value between A/A and G/G displayed in this
plot? Does the SNP effect the expression of ORMDL3?

``` r
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(expr) + aes(x=geno, y=exp, fill=geno) + geom_boxplot(notch=T)
```
