Section 4: Population Scale Analysis [HOMEWORK]
One sample is obviously not enough to know what is happening in a population. You are interested in assessing genetic differences on a population scale. So, you processed about ~230 samples and did the normalization on a genome level. Now, you want to find whetherthere is any association of the 4 asthma-associated SNPs (rs8067378â€¦) on ORMDL3 expression.


```{r}
expr <- read.table("Genome.txt")
head(expr)
```

```{r}
nrow(expr)
```


```{r}
table(expr$geno)
```


Q14: Generate a boxplot with a box per genotype, what could you infer from the relative expression value between A/A and G/G displayed in this plot? Does the SNP effect the expression of ORMDL3?

```{r}

library(ggplot2)
ggplot(expr) + aes(x=geno, y=exp, fill=geno) + geom_boxplot(notch=T)

```
